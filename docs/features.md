# Features
## Group Rules 
Add users to groups based on characters, corporations, alliances, and even corporation roles. Not amazingly useful by itself, but when paired with `django-discord-connector`, you'll have a fully automated authentication!

## Character Tracking
Track character data for members within your organization. Useful for audits, insights, and administration.
